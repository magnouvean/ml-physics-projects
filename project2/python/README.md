## Libraries
Some required non-standard libraries used here:
- jax
- numpy

## Runnable files
I have used python 3.10 for gathering the results. To run a program, use the
following command:
```{bash}
python3 {{path-of-file}}
```
## Outputs
The outputs from running the different files on my machine is contained withing
the [OUTPUTS.md](./OUTPUTS.md) file. Additionally running a lot of the files
produces figures as well. The names of these should be somewhat
self-explanatory, and they are contained within the [figures](../figures/)
directory.
