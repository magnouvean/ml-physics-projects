## Libraries
Some required non-standard libraries used here:
- jax
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pytest (only for the tests)
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- tensorflow (cpu version is what I used)

## Runnable files
I have used python 3.11 for gathering the results. To run a program, use the
following command:
```bash
python3 {{path-of-file}}
```
The following are programs meant to be ran:
- logisticregression_breastcancer.py
- neuralnet_breastcancer.py
- neuralnet_frankefunction.py
- optimization_basic.py

## Outputs
The outputs from running the different files on my machine is contained withing
the [OUTPUTS.md](./OUTPUTS.md) file. Additionally running a lot of the files
produces figures as well. The names of these should be somewhat
self-explanatory, and they are contained within the [figures](../figures/)
directory.
