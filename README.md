# ML-PHYSICS-PROJECTS
This is where. Keep in mind not all these are that physics-related, but I could
not find a better name for this repo.
## Structure
Throughout the three projects there will be created three different folders
project1, project2 and project 3. In these folders for all the code, data,
figures and report will be present. The code will reside in a folder of the name
of the programming language used. Project 1 uses julia, while the two others is
planned to be in python. In the code folder there is going to be a `README.md`
which describes the packages/libraries required for the, as well as which
programs are intended to be run directly, and which are libraries.
