## Libraries
Some required non-standard libraries used here:
- [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl)
- [ImageView.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageView.jl)
- [Images.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/Images.jl)
- [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl)
- [ScikitLearn.jl](https://github.com/cstjean/ScikitLearn.jl/)
- [StatsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl)

## Runnable files
To run a program, use the following command:
```{bash}
julia {{path-of-file}}
```
The following files are indented to be run directly to produce our results:
- FrankePlot.jl
- Landscape.jl
- Lasso.jl
- LinearRegression.jl
- Resampling.jl
- ResamplingCV.jl
- Ridge.jl

## Outputs
The outputs from running the different files on my machine is contained withing
the [OUTPUTS.md](./OUTPUTS.md) file. Additionally running a lot of the files
produces figures as well. The names of these should be somewhat
self-explanatory, and they are contained within the [figures](../figures/)
directory.
