# Project 3
See the [project README](../README.md) for structure of the files. Additionally
just like the other projects, see the [code README](./python/README.md) for
details of the code.

One difference between this and the other projects is that we also have a
folder for models. This can be handy for exploring the models I got when
training for example neural networks as tensorflow doesn't have great
reproducibility support. See [the tensorflow
documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load) for
how to load these in if you are interested. Additionally I have used a
data-folder in the code, but not included the data in this repository due to
the large size. Therefore, to run the code, create a folder `data` in this
directory and put the `creditcard_2023.csv` data file, which can be downloaded
from
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023),
in this folder and then everything should work fine.
