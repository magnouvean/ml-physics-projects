## Libraries
Some required non-standard libraries used here:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- tensorflow (cpu version is what I used)
- xgboost

## Runnable files
I have used python 3.11 for gathering the results. To run a program, make sure
you are in this directory use the following command:
```bash
python3 {{name-of-file}}
```
The following are programs meant to be ran:
- [datainfo.py](../python/datainfo.py) (only for a figure/info in the report)
- [lr_creditcard.py](../python/lr_creditcard.py)
- [nn_creditcard.py](../python/nn_creditcard.py)
- [swish_function_plot.py](../python/swish_function_plot.py) (only for a figure in the report)
- [xgb_creditcard.py](../python/xgb_creditcard.py)

## Outputs
The outputs from running the different files on my machine is contained withing
the [OUTPUTS.md](../OUTPUTS.md) file. Additionally running a lot of the files
produces figures as well. The names of these should be somewhat
self-explanatory, and they are contained within the [figures](../figures/)
directory.
